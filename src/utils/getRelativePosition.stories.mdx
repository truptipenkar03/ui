Many times a single element needs to be positioned with respect to another. A very common use case is a tooltip. Using
 the `getRelativePosition` utility, for a given anchor element (button), floater element (tooltip) and position the
  `top` and `left` position values can be calculated for the floater in order to position it relative to the anchor.

The positioning API allows for a range of allowable positions. See the element table below which shows the 9
 potential points that can be used on each element for positioning.

| | Left | Center | Right |
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Top** | tl | tc | tr
**Center** | cl | cc | cr
**Bottom** | bl | bc | br


<SectionTitle>Example</SectionTitle>

```
import { getRelativePosition } from '@rtkwlf/ui';

// Position center-left point of anchor with center-right point of floater
const position = ['cl', 'cr'];

const floaterPosition = getRelativePosition(anchorElement, floaterElement, position);
```
